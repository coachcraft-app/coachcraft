## To Start Developing
- Make sure you're in the `/web` directory
- `npm install` (install dependencies)
- `npm run dev`
- Open the displayed localhost address in a browser, this is where changes will be reflected in real time as you develop
> Hot reloading is enabled, to see your changes reflected, just save whatever file you're editing within `/web` and find the changes reflected on the live localhost address.

## To Build
- `npm run build`
> Built/bundled files are stored by Vite in `./dist`
